# Naval Battle Calculator

This Group Project was made in IPT 7.1 during my second year at the IMS.

## Project Description

This project is based on a strategic game known as **HOI4** and seeks to simulate naval battles as well as calculate naval supremacy. These battles are notoriously hard to predict in the game due to the extensive use of complex algorithms. 

The project features:
- A simple login system where users can create and log in to accounts.
- A saving and loading system that allows users to recall a saved configuration of their selected naval groups.
